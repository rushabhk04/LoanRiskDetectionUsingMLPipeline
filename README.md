# Automated ML Pipeline for Loan Risk Prediction

## Project Overview
I built an **automated machine learning (ML) pipeline** for **loan risk prediction** using Python. This pipeline is designed to automate the end-to-end process of training and deploying a classification model to predict loan risk efficiently. It consists of:
- **Model Training**: Preprocessing input data, training a classification model, and optimizing it using hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Inference**: Loading the best-trained model and running predictions on new data.
- **Model Deployment**: Storing and retrieving the best-performing model for production use.
- **Monitoring & Fine-Tuning**: Continuously evaluating model performance and making improvements when needed.

## Why I Built This
Loan risk assessment is crucial in the financial sector, where predicting defaults can save companies significant losses. My goal was to:
- **Automate the ML workflow** to reduce manual intervention and ensure consistency.
- **Improve accuracy** through feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and robust evaluation.
- **Ensure scalability** by making it easy to update and retrain models as new data comes in.
- **Create a deployable solution** that could integrate with real-world applications.

## Solution Design
### Data Preprocessing
One of the biggest challenges I faced was handling missing values and ensuring feature consistency. My approach:
- **Numerical Features**:
  - Imputed missing values with the **mean** to avoid data loss.
  - Applied **Min-Max scaling** to normalize features and prevent bias due to varying ranges.
- **Categorical Features**:
  - Imputed missing values using the **mode (most frequent value)** to maintain categorical integrity.
  - Used **one-hot encoding** to convert categorical values into numerical format while preserving information.

### Model Training
To find the best model, I used **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning. The process included:
- Defining a **parameter grid** with different hyperparameters.
- Running **cross-validation** to find the optimal parameter combination.
- Training the final model using the best parameters found.

Challenges:
- **Selecting the best model**: I tested multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and chose the best-performing one based on evaluation metrics.
- **Avoiding overfitting**: Used **cross-validation** and **regularization techniques** to generalize the model effectively.

### Model Evaluation
Since this is a **binary classification problem** (low-risk vs. high-risk loans), I evaluated the model using:
- **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Accuracy)
- **Confusion Matrix** to analyze false positives and false negatives
- **ROC-AUC Score** for overall model discrimination

Key Metrics Achieved:
- **Accuracy**: ~90%
- **Precision**: High precision to minimize false alarms in high-risk cases.
- **Recall**: Ensured high recall to catch as many risky loans as possible.

### Model Deployment
To make the trained model reusable, I:
- **Saved the best model** as a `.joblib` file in the `models/` directory.
- Implemented a **function to load the latest model**, selecting based on the last modified date.
- Named the model files with **accuracy score and timestamp** to track versions easily.

### Monitoring & Fine-Tuning
Model performance can degrade over time due to **data drift** or **changes in loan applicant behavior**. To handle this:
- I included **model monitoring mechanisms** to track performance on new data.
- If performance drops, the model is retrained with updated data.
- Feature engineering improvements are considered to enhance predictive power.
